title: Poison Sting
step: 4

After your puddle marker drops, head back to center.

After the last Poison Sting puddle drops, there will be a role-based,
double stack mechanic: **Bee Sting**

One stack will target a random DPS, the other will target a random Support

Stack with your role, as far separated from the other stack as you can:

* *Support*: Stack North-West, just inside the safe area
* *DPS*: Stack South-East, just inside the safe area

After this goes off, prepare to remember whether Spread or Stack was saved at
the beginning of this section...
