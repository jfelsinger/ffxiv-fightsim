Two at a time, one support and one DPS, will be targeted with a Prey Marker.

6s after being marked, a puddle will be dropped on each marked player.

The two marked players should head to opposite edges of the arena, based on
the party's strategy for the mechanic, ex:

* Supports (<span class="healer">Healer</span>/<span class="tank">Tank</span>) far North, and <span class="dps">DPS</span> far South
* <span class="dps">DPS</span> far East, and Supports (<span class="healer">Healer</span>/<span class="tank">Tank</span>) far West

The puddle drops will repeat **4** times, until every player has been targeted.

If you weren't marked first, note the rotation of the next set of Worker Bee's.

For subsequent drops, you'll want to either head just *clockwise* or just *counter-clockwise* of the last dropped puddle.

Rotate the same way that the Worker Bee's are rotating.

The puddle drops will repeat **4** times, until every player has been targeted.

The Bee's line-AOEs will repeat **6** times, through until the next mechanic (a double tower stack).
