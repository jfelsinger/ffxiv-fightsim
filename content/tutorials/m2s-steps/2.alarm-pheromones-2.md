title: Alarm Pheromones
step: 2
---

This is the mechanic with the Worker Bees/stingers, and long line-AOEs across
the arena. Unlike the chaos of the first time this is cast, the AOEs here
will follow a pretty-consistent rotating square pattern.

For the second casting of **Alarm Pheromones**, head to the center of the
arena. Within the boss's inner ring, or within the middle hexagon. This
position will be a safe spot from the Worker Bees for this mechanic.

Within the center, you will want to separate by roles. Depending on *PF*
it will probably be either:

* Supports (<span class="healer">Healer</span>/<span class="tank">Tank</span>) North, and <span class="dps">DPS</span> South

* <span class="dps">DPS</span> East, and Supports (<span class="healer">Healer</span>/<span class="tank">Tank</span>) West

This will be important, for a tower-stack that comes later
