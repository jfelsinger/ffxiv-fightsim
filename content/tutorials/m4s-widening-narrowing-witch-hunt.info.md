title: Widening/Narrowing Witch Hunt - DN Strat
category: Tutorial
---

*This panel is a WIP.*

**Narrowing/Widening Witch Hunt** consists of a set of four alternating in/out AOEs and near/far baits. The first AOE indicated by the cast:

* **Widening** Witch Hunt - The party should spread (move out *wide*), the first AOE will be in an area around the boss.
* **Narrowing** Witch Hunt - The party should head closer to the boss, the first AOE will be a ring around the outer
half of the arena.

The baits are indicated by the symbols that appear on the boss:

![M4S far Tell](/images/fights/m4s/far-1.png){ height="40" }

The glyphs on the symbol are *separated far out*, telling you that the bait will be **far**.

![M4S near Tell](/images/fights/m4s/near-1.png){ height="40" }

The glyphs on this symbol are *smashed near together*, telling you that the bait will be **near**.


### The DN Strat

For the DN strat, you can ignore the near/far baits, the symbols. Instead each role has two pairs of positions to
memorize:

* Where to stand for the first inner AOE
* Where to stand or move for the first outer AOE
* Where to move to for the second inner AOE
* Where to move to for the second outer AOE

As long as everyone is standing in their correct spot when the AOE snapshots, you should clear this mechanic no problem.

(You can pick your role here in the sim in the upper-right, above the mini-map)

For the positions themselves, you should use the arena floor itself, or the boss, for proper positioning. Waymarks in PF
might be setup to facilitate separate mechanics later in the fight and not setup for Witch Hunt, but the arena never
changes and is safe to use to help you properly position yourself.
