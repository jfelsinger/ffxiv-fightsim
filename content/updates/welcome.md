This site is a side project that I created because I wanted to be able to practice the more
involved raids and mechanics in FFXIV before forcing the poor people in party finder to
scoop me up off the floor.

So far, I only have one entry, [a small part of E12S](/raids/e12s/primal-combinations), which
can be played.

Here's some current features:

* Move and control a character through the browser similarly to FFXIV, using **KB/M** or **controller**
* **Slow time** to make things easier
* Adjust how long or short telegraphed AOEs are
* Use YAML/JSON to change or script encounters in the sim's code editor.

And here's some things that I am going to work on adding ASAP:

* **Control preferences**, so you can make the browser sim behave more similarly to your own game.
* More mechanics, more encounters!
* NPC party members (scripted or w/ simple simple AI) for practicing stacks and other similar mechanics.
* Controlling the details of a fight through UI, instead of just the script editor.

I have other things I want to add later on down the line. Mainly, a system for
simulating skill casts, so that users can practice integrating their rotations into
encounters. I'm open to suggestions too. So, stay tuned for updates. :)

My hope, and goal now, is to first make this a useful tool and hopefully, eventually,
something that makes raiding feel accessible to more people. ðŸ¤ž

Big Love,

Gank.
