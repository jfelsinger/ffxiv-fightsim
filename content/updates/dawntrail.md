description: Rushing to get more new content in this tool!

I recently had myself a move across the country which put a damper on this
project while I got situated. Not only that, also had to do my own FFXIV
playing and catch-up for Dawntrail before trying to release more here. Everything
has been slowing down though, which means...

Finally starting to add more content here!

I am working on some more complicated content/features for this tool, and better
simulating of effects so that this can be useful for the new content coming out.

None of the new stuff I'm working on is out yet, but as a precursor this update
comes with a rough release of one of the mechanics from M2S.

#### Other changes in this update:

Added functionality for being able to adjust HUD elements, like the cast-bar.
You'll be able to move HUD elements around, and have them saved, so your experience
can be more similar to your actual game.

Added a cast bar effect, and options for it, and mechanic/effect options to get
that rendered

A bunch of undocumented stuff too.


#### Next Iteration

The plan for next iteration will be to add markers, and also support saved-marker format (or whatever that thing is that
icy-veins uses).
