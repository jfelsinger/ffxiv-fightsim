In a previous update I mentioned I'd be working on some new Dawntrail
content, and I have Been.

I've polished up the [M2S Centerstage/Outerstage practice sim](https://xivfightsim.com/raids/m2s/stage-combo?info=1).
I've added support for raid markers into the system, added graphics
for the M2S fight, and also started working on a new type of interface
for learning mechanics:

#### The Tutorials interface
Basically, it's supposed to work like a step-by-step interactive tutorial?

The first entry is a tutorial for [M2S's Alarm Pheromones, Second
Casting](https://xivfightsim.com/tutorials/m2s-alarm-pheromones-2). It actually,
kinda works too. Just, if you want to restart the fight, you have to
actually refresh the browser, some of the usual controls are bit busted.

Despite the bugs, hope you like how the new content is working!

#### Upcoming...
* Adding the actual spread/stack mechanic for Drop/Splash of Poison
* Turning off the tutorial in tutorial mode
* Fixing/Improving the UI in tutorial mode
* Code clean-up, lots of messiness with this new push
