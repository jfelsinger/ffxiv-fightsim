For this mechanic in the fight, the boss will telegraph a pair of combined
AOEs by absorbing energy from the crystals. The color of the energy will
determine which AOEs are being telegraphed.

* Leviathan (Blue): The AOE will hit both the East and West thirds of the arena, leaving just the center corridor safe.
* Garuda (Green): The AOE will strike in all 4 cardinal directions, diagonals are safe.
* Ramuh (Purple): The AOE will strike in circle in the middle of the arena, move away from the boss.
* Ifrit (Red): The AOE will strike a wide area to the north and south of the boss, stay close to center on the east or west of the boss.

Two of these AOEs will be telegraphed at random, and occur at the same time, which you will have to identify together,
and coordinate to dodge.
