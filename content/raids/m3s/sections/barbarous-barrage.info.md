title: Barbarous Barrage
raid: M3S - Arcadion Light-Heavyweight
category: Mechanic
---

This mechanic begins when Brute Bomber starts casting Barbarous Barrage. Shortly
after the cast ends, 6 knock-back towers will appear, shortly after that a center
knock-back tower will also appear.

The two **middle towers** will go off first, and each need **4** people stacked to them.
The **corner towers** will go off next, and need **2** people stacked. The
**central tower** that appears slightly later, will need **everyone** stacked on
it and goes off last.

The 6 towers that appear first will be in two lines of 3, positioned either North and
South or East and West.

At the same time that the knock-back towers are resolving, Brute Bomber will teleport
to a corner and begin to cast "Murderous Mist". When the last knock-back tower goes off,
make sure you are positioned so that you get knocked-back to the same corner that the boss
is in.

1. Split into four pairs, and have two pairs each take one of the middle towers. Position
so that that each pair is knocked-back to one of the corners on the opposite side of the arena.
The boss should teleport to a corner right before the first knock-back happens. Take note
of which corner he teleports to.
2. A single pair should have been knocked-back to each corner tower. Quickly position yourself
to be knocked-back again, this time aiming for the center tower.
3. As soon as you are knocked-back, everyone should be near the center tower. Everyone, position
to be knocked-back to the same corner as the boss.
4. If all goes well, Murderous Mist should resolve and you should be safe in the corner.
